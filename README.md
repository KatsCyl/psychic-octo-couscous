# Psychic-octo-couscos

This is a rewrite of [this](https://github.com/Everyfish/psychic-octo-couscous) monstrosity, and hopefully a effort to actually finish this
maybe decent game.

### Installing

```
cd psychic-octo-couscos/
npm install
```

### Developing

```
grunt watch
```
Will automatically compile changes, and whine about errors. To see the game, you have to host a http-server, easiest way is to
```
npm install -g http-server
http-server dist/
```
